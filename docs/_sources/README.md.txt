### Contacts [Optional]
Jarvis can send on demand notifications using a ``contacts.yaml`` file stored in ``fileio`` directory. Uses [gmail-connector](https://pypi.org/project/gmail-connector/) for SMS and email notifications.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

> Note: Jarvis currently supports sending emails only when the ``contacts.yaml`` file is present, however phone numbers can be used directly.

```yaml
phone:
  Tony: 0123456789
  Thor: 1234567890
email:
  Eddard: ned@gmail.com
  Aegon: egg@yahoo.com
```
</details>

### Smart Devices [Optional]
Jarvis supports `MagicHome` for [lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C7GY43L), `LGWebOS` and `Roku` for TVs.
> This feature requires a `smart_devices.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

- TV hostnames should include the brand name [`LG`/`Roku`] to distinguish the modules accordingly.
  - This will be set by default, if yours doesn't include the brand name change it in the TV settings.

- To wake up `Roku` TVs using MAC address, make sure the `Bandwidth saver` feature is turned off under,
    ```text
    Settings/Network/Bandwidth saver >> Off
    ```

- For first time users on `LGWebOS` TVs, there will be a prompt on the TV to accept the connection request.
  - Once the connection request is accepted a client key will be generated and logged.
  - Please make sure to store this in `smart_devices.yaml` file to avoid repeated connection prompt.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

- The source file should have an initial key to distinguish between `Lights` and `TV`
- The name used in the keys (for both lights and tv) will be the identifier when an action is requested.
- Lights should be a dictionary of identifier and a list of hostnames.
- TVs should be a nested dictionary of multiple parameters.
- The source file (`smart_devices.yaml`) should be as following:

```yaml
Lights:
  bedroom:
    - 'HOSTNAMES'
  hallway:
    - 'HOSTNAMES'
  hallway basement:
    - 'HOSTNAMES'
  kitchen:
    - 'HOSTNAMES'
  living room:
    - 'HOSTNAMES'
TV:
  living room tv:
    hostname: 'LGWebOSTV'
    client_key: 'CLIENT_KEY'  # Generated automatically if unavailable
    mac_address:  # Mac addresses can either be a string or a list
    - 'WIRED_MAC_ADDRESS'
    - 'WIRELESS_MAC_ADDRESS'
  bedroom tv:
    hostname: 'RokuTV'
    mac_address: 'MAC_ADDRESS'
```
</details>

### Startup Scripts [Optional]
Jarvis can execute any python or shell script during startup without any user interaction.
> This feature requires a directory called `scripts` within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

Simply place the startup script within the `fileio/scripts`. Jarvis will only trigger the scripts those names that 
end with `.py` or `.sh` or `.zsh` without having an `_` at the begining.

**Example:**

In the example below, only the scripts `ngrok.py` and `stack.sh` will be triggered.

```markdown
fileio/
|-- scripts/
|   |-- ngrok.py
|   |-- stack.sh
|   |-- _offline.py
```

</details>

### Automation [Optional]
Jarvis can execute [offline compatible](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/executors/conditions.py) tasks 
at pre-defined times without any user interaction.
> This feature requires an `automation.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should contain a dictionary within a dictionary that looks like the below.

**OPTIONAL:** The key, `day` can be a `list` of days, or a `str` of a specific day or simply a `str` saying `weekday` or
`weekend` when the particular automation should be executed.

> Not having the key `day` will run the automation daily.
> Date format should match exactly as described below.

```yaml
06:00 AM:
  - task: set my bedroom lights to 50%
    day: weekday  # Runs only between Monday and Friday
06:30 AM:
  - task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
    day:  # Runs only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
    - Monday
    - wednesday
    - FRIDAY
08:00 AM:  # Runs only on Saturday and Sunday
  - task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
    day: weekend
09:00 PM:  # Runs daily (can take both list of dict and dict as argument)
  task: set my bedroom lights to 5%
12:00 AM:  # Even performs tasks that are not supported via voice commands
  - task: restart all background processes
  - task: turn off all lights
    day: weekday
```
</details>

### Background Tasks [Optional]
Jarvis supports both internal and external background tasks to be scheduled.

- Jarvis can run internal tasks at certain intervals.
> This feature requires a `background_tasks.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

```yaml
- seconds: 1_800
  task: just turn off all lights  # Runs every 30 minutes - 'just' flag retains the lights' last setting (eg: brightness or color)
  ignore_hours:  # Ignore the schedule at 5 AM and 10 PM
    - 5
    - 22
- seconds: 10_800
  task: remind me to drink water  # Runs every 3 hours ignoring the hours specified
  ignore_hours: "21-6"  # Ignore the schedule between 9 PM and 6 AM
```
</details>

### Restrictions [Optional]
Jarvis can place function(s) level [restrictions](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/executors/restrictions.py) for offline communicators.

- This restriction can also be modified by offline communicators.
- Once a restriction is placed, the matching commands will not be executed unless the restriction is removed explicitly.

> This feature requires a `restrictions.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should contain a list of function names that looks like the below.

```yaml
- car  # Blocks ALL car related operations via offline communication
- garage  # Blocks ALL garage related operations via offline communication
```

:warning: This is a direct mapping to the [functions](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/executors/functions.py), 
so invalid function names are not validated by Jarvis. This will make the restriction void.

</details>

### Custom Conditions [Optional]
Jarvis can execute function(s) directly based on a [custom condition](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/executors/custom_conditions.py) map,
via both voice and offline communicators.

- The condition mapping may contain one or more functions to be executed for a single keyword/phrase.
- These functions are executed as ordered in the mapping file and responses will be delivered as each task is done.
- For offline communicators, in case of multi-function mapping, the responses are gathered and then delivered at once.

> This feature requires a `conditions.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should contain a dictionary within a dictionary that looks like the below.

```yaml
lumos:  # custom keyword
  lights: turn on all lights  # function_name: phrase passed as argument
knox:
  lights: turn off all lights
  television: turn off bedroom tv
fire up the chopper:  # custom phrase
  garage: open garage
  car: start car
```

:warning: This is a direct mapping to the [functions](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/executors/functions.py), 
so the input phrases are not validated by Jarvis. This will raise a `UserWarning` if invalid function name or phrase is entered in the mapping file.

</details>

### Simulation [Optional]
Jarvis can execute tasks as a simulation to test the required functions and send an email with the results.
> This feature requires a `simulation.yaml` file which should be stored within the `fileio` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong><i>Setup Instructions</i></strong></summary>

The YAML file should contain a list of phrases within a dictionary that looks like the below.

```yaml
meeting_event:
- get me the events from my calendar
- what meetings do I have today
```
